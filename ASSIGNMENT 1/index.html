      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mildred Obiora</p>
      <p><strong>Track:</strong> School of Engineering - Backend</p>
      <p><strong>AltSchool ID: </strong><b><em>ALT/SOE/024/5545</em></b></p>

      <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
      <p>
        Mildred is a graduate of Geoinformatics and Surveying from the
        University of Nigeria, Enugu campus. She is a professional Land
        Surveyor, who specializes in Railway construction, Land Administration
        and GIS. With nearly a decade in the field, she has gone further to
        obtain her Professional certificate recognizing her as a Surveyor of the
        federal republic of Nigeria and equally fit to practice in her field in
        numerous capacity. She is currently rounding up a Master's degree
        program in GIS and remote sensing. As a member of the <strong><em>Altschool Africa 2024 Cohort</em></strong>,
        She has taken up this journey into
        Backend Engineering because she believes the skills she gains here can
        aid her in pivoting to an interesting career path while leveraging on
        prior knowledge from GIS.<br />
        Mildred has spent most years of her career on the field, across Nigeria,
        so she is not a newbie when it comes to working hard and putting in the
        work. This could be a much needed opportunity to do interesting and
        maybe tough work, but equally be able to take care of her family in the
        near future.<br />
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        So, in summary She is doing this as a future investment, and trusts that
        it will pay off. Her Goal is to finish this program with as much needed
        knowlege to perform well in the booming <strong><em>tech space</em></strong> and
        perhaps earn better, in dollars, and be able to work remotely. <br> 
        I believe AltSchool Africa is a great decision for anyone looking to pick up a Tech Skill, 
        either to pivot or to start a new career path.
